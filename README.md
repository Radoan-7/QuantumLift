# 🧠⚛️ QuantumLift — Elevate Smarter with Quantum Logic

![QuantumLift Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.jpg)

## 🚀 Inspiration  
This idea came from my own university experience. Our elevator often stopped at empty floors—just because someone pressed the button and left.  
**What if the elevator knew no one was actually there?** That’s where **quantum concepts** and **real-time video detection** come together.

## 🌀 What It Does  
QuantumLift lets you explore **quantum gate logic** like Hadamard and CNOT in a visual, hands-on way.  
But here’s the twist—it also **controls elevator logic**, predicting whether a person is truly waiting and making real-time decisions to reduce unnecessary stops.

## 🌟 Why It’s Unique  
Most elevators respond blindly to button presses.  
**QuantumLift doesn’t.** It uses:

- **Quantum-inspired probabilities** to keep calls “uncertain” (superposed) until verified.  
- **VideoDB** to detect presence around the elevator.  
- **Dynamic path optimization** that avoids wasting energy on ghost calls.

This hybrid system mimics a quantum collapse: a call only becomes “real” when someone’s presence is confirmed.

## 🌍 Real-World Impact  
Imagine elevators that skip stops where nobody’s there.  
QuantumLift saves:

- ⏱️ **Time** by reducing wait and idle travel  
- 🔋 **Energy** by cutting pointless stops  
- 😌 **Frustration** with smarter, smoother rides

Perfect for crowded campuses, offices, or high-rises.

## 🛠️ How It’s Built  
Everything was built solo—every gate, every logic, every animation.

- **Frontend:** React.js + HTML5 + CSS3  
- **Logic Engine:** Qiskit.js & QuantumCircuit.js  
- **Cloud:** Firebase (Realtime DB & Hosting)  
- **Animations:** Framer Motion  
- **Integration:** Bolt SDK  
- **Detection:** VideoDB API for human presence simulation

## 🧱 Challenges I Ran Into  
- Simulating **quantum entanglement visually** in a beginner-friendly way  
- Designing UI that feels both **educational and futuristic**  
- Merging **quantum simulation** and **real-world elevator logic**

## ✅ Accomplishments I’m Proud Of  
- Created a **dual-mode system** (learn + apply)  
- Turned a **day-to-day pain** into a **quantum-powered solution**  
- Made quantum logic **accessible and interactive** for students

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Deep understanding of **quantum circuit behavior**  
- Real-time decision systems  
- Creative ways to **blend AI, quantum ideas, and UI/UX**

## 🔮 What’s Next for QuantumLift  
- Add real camera input for **live presence detection**  
- Train VideoDB with better datasets for movement prediction  
- Optimize elevator algorithms with **actual quantum solvers**
